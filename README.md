## About Setup Instruction

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- Simply clone the project using git clone command.
- Copy .env.example and paste it with .env name
- php artisan key: generate
- put the env variable "OPENWEATHERMAP_KEY" into the .env file
- composer install
- npm install
- create databse with the name of laravel
- php artisan migrate
- php artisan db:seed --class=CitySeeder
